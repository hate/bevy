# Benchmarks (Taffy 0.2 vs Taffy 0.1 and Yoga)

- Taffy `0.1` results come from commit `52794ddf23dea463fcad5fb73db4f8362b894866`
- Taffy `0.2` results come from commit `44763a9e74e87423f3158014d6d06c762ce44d19`
- Run on a 2021 MacBook Pro with M1 Pro processor.
- Taffy benchmarks are using criterion (10 iterations).
- Yoga benchmarks run via the `yoga-layout-prebuilt` npm package, they were run a few times manually and it was verified that variance in the numbers of each run was minimal. It should be noted that this is using an old version of Yoga.
